<!-- THIS IS IMPORTANT. THIS IS HOW THE VIEW SEES THE MODEL we write the fully qualified
  namespace for the sciFiBook model class. This is weird because we seem to be skipping the Controller class
  and referencing a model directly-->

  <!-- This is the hard part.
    1. This file has the same name as the action result method on control.  public ActionResult Detail()
       This can't run if the name of the action result is differnt.
    2. This calls the SciFiBook data layer directly?  -->
  <!-- his right here ^^ above is "Razor" bit that combines C# and HTML it is c# -->
  <!-- This is C# code setting the layout property to null the layout page is the overall look and feel for the site-->
  <!-- To get files inn we add them through file explorer hit "view all files" then right click and "add to project"-->
  <!-- I fucked up the start path so we need to enter this http://localhost:53780/SciFi/Detail -->
  <!--We are just calling c# vars herer-->
